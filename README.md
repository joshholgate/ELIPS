Electrohydrodynamic Linear Stability of Plasma Surface

Main file ELIPS.cc calculates linearly-perturbed plasma variables (electric potential and field, ion velocity and density) at the surface of a sinusoidally-corrugated surface in a Bohm sheath.

Analysis codes ELIPS-critphi.py and ELIPS-minphi.py are used to determine the linear stability of the surface if it is liquid from the raw data contained in output-raw folder.
