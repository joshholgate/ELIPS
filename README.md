# ELIPS
Electrohydrodynamic Linear Stability of Plasma Surface

Main file ELIPS.cc calculates linearly-perturbed plasma variables (electric potential and field, ion velocity and density) at the surface of a sinusoidally-corrugated surface in a Bohm sheath.

The data-analysis folder contains the analysis codes ELIPS-critphi.py and ELIPS-minphi.py, together with the gnuplot scripts critphi.plt and minphi.plt, which are used to determine the stability limits of a liquid surface from the raw data contained in output-raw folder.
